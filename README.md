# Matching_Card

Game Logic:

1. Initialize a deck of cards with pairs.
2. Shuffle the cards and place them face down on the grid.
3. Track selected cards and check for matches when two cards are revealed.
4. If they match, keep them face up; otherwise, flip them back after a short delay.


Design Game Layout:

1. Create a JFrame to serve as the main window.
2. Use JPanel to hold the card components and layout.
3. Utilize GridLayout for arranging cards in a grid format.
